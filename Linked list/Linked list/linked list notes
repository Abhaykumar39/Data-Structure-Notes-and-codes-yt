 LINKED LIST  
 
 A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes.here each node store the data and the address of the next node.

SINGLY LINKED LIST--
It is the most common. Each node has the data and pointer to the next node. 

Doubly LINKED LIST--
  Add a pointer to the  previous node in a doubly linked list.thus we can go in either direction.
  forward or backward.

  Circular linked list--
  A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last node are also connected to each other to form a circle.
  There are  basically two types of circularlinked list:

  1. circular singly linked list:
  Here, the address of the last node  consists of the address of the first node

  2:Circular doubly linked list:
  here, in addition to the last node storing the address of the first node
  the first node will also store the address of the last node.
